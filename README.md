## What Is SNES-IDE?

SNES-IDE is an open-source, cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for creating SNES games using [pvsneslib](https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib).  
It works natively on Windows, Linux Ubuntu and macOS, and provides tools, templates, and automation for building, compiling, and testing SNES ROMs.

- **Languages:** C (main) and some assembly (65816 and spc700).
- **Compilers:** [816-tcc](https://github.com/alekmaul/tcc) and [wla-dx](https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx) from pvsneslib.
- **Main Library:** [pvsneslib](https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib) version 4.3.
- **Emulator:** [bsnes](https://github.com/bsnes-emu/bsnes) and [lakesnes](https://github.com/angelo-wf/lakesnes) for testing.
- **Cross-platform:** Works natively on Windows, Linux Ubuntu and macOS.
- **Build from Source:** Full support for building all tools and the IDE itself from source.
